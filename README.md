Within Rune's architecture, **Ether** defines truth, **Essence** holds flow, and **Entity** performs behavior - each awakened only when invoked. Every element is crafted to be composable, lazy-loaded, and purpose-driven, making systems naturally scalable and precise. 

This makes Rune inherently lightweight and adaptable, aligning perfectly with projects that evolve from concept, not convention. Whether shaping internal tools, backend systems, or modular workflows, Rune empowers developers to sculpt structure from intent, not instruction.

## Awakening
Install Rune using Composer:
```bash
composer require devneet/rune:1.x-dev
```

Create main file:
```bash
echo "#rune" > cast
```

First invocation awaken Rune from the void:
```php
<?php
/*
 * Act. 0 - Awaken From The Void
 * THE VOID
 *
 * From the silence of nothingness, echoes rise from the void.
 * A journey begins - with runes at your side.
 * 
 * */
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

Rune\Ethereal::awakening();
```

Run the app to begin:
```bash
php cast
```

Explore the systemâ€™s using the Grimoire:
```bash
php cast grimoire
```



## Paradigm
At first, humans did not know anything.  
Then how did they start to know things, and learn more about them?  

By looking, writing, and growing, we can finally understand.  

1. Core
- **Rune** = something we don't know yet
- **Ethereal** = a place or thing we don't know

2. Subject
- **Ether** = something that never changes but always has meaning
- **Essence** = something that can change as time goes on
- **Entity** = something that makes other things change
- **Manifest** = a box to connect things so they can work together
- **Phantasm** = a picture in our mind to understand

3. Others
- **Awakening** = starting something, from anywhere
- **Liberation** = being free and making something new
- **Echoes** = sounds from the past
- **Runite** = a rune that becomes a thing
- **Shard** = a small piece of runite
- **Bindrune** = many runes joined together
- **Grimoire** = a book that feels alive
- **Sentinel** = someone or something that guards
- **Artefact** = a thing we can see
