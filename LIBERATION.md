# LIBERATION

The liberation of the Rune from its initial location **Origin** to the **contributors**.
Full freedom is granted (100%), and the only thing that remains of the **Rune** is the **Concept of Paradigm**.

Pretty straightforward, right? In short: just total freedom.


## âœ¦ The possibility obtained
- [x] Building an entirely new working environment.
- [x] Creating a completely different workflow.
- [x] Making your own Rune, either Public (contribute) or Private (local).
